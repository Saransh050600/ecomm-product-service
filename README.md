# ecomm-product-service
The ecomm-product-service is a backend microservice built using Node.js + Express that manages all product-related operations in the eCommerce application. It provides RESTful APIs for retrieving, creating, updating, and deleting product information, and supports features like category filtering, pagination, and admin-level access control.

It integrates with:
  - MongoDB for data persistence
